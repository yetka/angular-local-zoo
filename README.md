## Description

This website allows Zoo workers to track animals in their Zoo. It is created to be user-unfriendly and to allow zoo workers to track different animals' attributes. In the future this application will contain some additional features that help users to create their own forms to add new animals attributes as they will need it.
* User can log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.
* User can view a list of logged animals.
* User has options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (2 years of age and older).
* User can click an animal to edit its name, age or caretakers.
